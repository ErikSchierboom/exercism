# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for ECMAScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

http://exercism.io/languages/ecmascript

## Requirements

They are already described in the link above, but just as a
quick reference:

Install globally a tool to run [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) if
it is not installed yet:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ gulp test
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
