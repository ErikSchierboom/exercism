Welcome to Leap on Exercism's Odin Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Introduction

A leap year (in the Gregorian calendar) occurs:

- In every year that is evenly divisible by 4.
- Unless the year is evenly divisible by 100, in which case it's only a leap year if the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

Some examples:

- 1997 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 4.
- 1900 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 400.
- 2000 was a leap year!
