## Running the tests

To run the tests from within the exercise directory, run the command:

```sh
odin test .
```

While you are testing, Odin can "vet" your code: it can look for things like unused imports and variables. Run your tests with:

```sh
odin test . -vet
```

For more options, see `odin test -help`.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit protein_translation.odin` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
