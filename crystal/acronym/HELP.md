# Help

## Running the tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ crystal spec
```

## Skipped tests

In each test suite all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by changing `pending` to `it`.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit src/acronym.cr` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
