# Hints

## General

- Don't worry about specific number types, just use `Int32` and `Float64` for now.
- Int32 and Float64 are the default number types in crystal, so you don't need to specify them.

## 1. Convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin

- You can use the arithmetic operator(`+`) to add numbers.

## 2. Round the temperature

- You can use the `round` method to round a number to a specific number of decimal places.
- The round method takes an argument `places` that specifies the number of decimal places to round to.

## 3. Convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit

- You can use the arithmetic operator(`*`) to multiply numbers.
- You can use parentheses(`()`) to group operations.

## 4. Get the number of missing sensors

- You can use the arithmetic operator(`-`) to subtract numbers.
- You can use the arithmetic operator(`%`) to get the remainder of a division.
