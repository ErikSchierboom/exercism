## Running the tests

To test your solution, open the terminal and run

```
mason test
```

in the exercise folder (the one containing the `Mason.toml` file and the `src/` and `test/` folders).

If you feel like the error message is not informative enough, you may try the following to get a more verbose one.

```
mason test --show
```

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit src/hello-world.chpl` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
