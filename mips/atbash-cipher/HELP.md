## Running the tests

To run the tests on the command line, run the following command from the exercise's directory:

```bash
java -jar /path/to/mars.jar nc runner.mips impl.mips
```

## GUI

To run the tests via the MARS simulator GUI, `include` your implementation at the bottom of `runner.mips`
by uncommenting the final line.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit impl.mips` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
