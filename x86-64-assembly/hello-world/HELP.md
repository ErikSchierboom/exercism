## Running the tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
make
```

## Skipped tests

Solving an exercise means making all its tests pass. By default, only one test
(the first one) is executed when you run the tests. This is intentional, as it
allows you to focus on just making that one test pass. Once it passes, you can
enable the next test by removing the `TEST_IGNORE()` line. When all tests have
been enabled and your implementation makes them all pass, you'll have solved
the exercise!

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit hello_world.asm` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
