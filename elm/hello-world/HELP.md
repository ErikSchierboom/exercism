# Help

## Running the tests

Run the command `elm-test` from within the exercise directory to run the tests.

This assumes that you have already followed the installation instructions for the Elm track.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit src/HelloWorld.elm` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
