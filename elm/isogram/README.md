# Isogram

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

## Elm Installation

Refer to the [Exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/elm) for Elm
installation and learning resources.

## Writing the Code

The first time you start an exercise, you'll need to ensure you have the
appropriate dependencies installed.

```bash
$ elm-package install --yes
```

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elm-test
```

Automatically run tests again when you save changes:

```bash
$ elm-test --watch
```

As you work your way through the test suite, be sure to remove the `skip <|`
calls from each test until you get them all passing!
