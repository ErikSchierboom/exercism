# Anagram

Welcome to Anagram on Exercism's R Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word.
Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams of the given word.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

The instructions above refer to "lists" in the general sense and not to the `list()` data type in R. Note that the tests for this exercise in R expect a character vector i.e. `c()` to be returned and not a `list()`.
