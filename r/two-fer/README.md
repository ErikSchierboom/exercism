# Two Fer

Welcome to Two Fer on Exercism's R Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Introduction

In some English accents, when you say "two for" quickly, it sounds like "two fer".
Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free.
So the phrase "two-fer" often implies a two-for-one offer.

Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!").
You go for the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to a friend.

## Instructions

Your task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.

If your friend likes cookies, and is named Do-yun, then you will say:

```text
One for Do-yun, one for me.
```

If your friend doesn't like cookies, you give the cookie to the next person in line at the bakery.
Since you don't know their name, you will say _you_ instead.

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

|Name    |Dialogue
|:-------|:------------------
|Alice   |One for Alice, one for me.
|Bohdan  |One for Bohdan, one for me.
|        |One for you, one for me.
|Zaphod  |One for Zaphod, one for me.
