# Fizz Buzz

Welcome to Fizz Buzz on Exercism's R Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Print numbers from 1 to n with the following exceptions:

1. When a number is a multiple of 3, then print "Fizz"
2. When a number is a multiple of 5, then print "Buzz"
3. When a number is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5, then print "Fizz Buzz"

The output should be a vector of strings, such as, "1" "2" "Fizz" "4" "Buzz" ...
