## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `busted` from within the exercise directory.

Refer to the [Installing Lua locally][install] documentation to get Lua and busted installed correctly.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit protein-translation.lua` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
