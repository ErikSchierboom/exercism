## Introduction

A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform some action.
There are multiple ways to define functions in JavaScript.
Here we will look at _function declarations_ and _function expressions_.
Other possibilities like [arrow functions][concept-arrow-functions] will be covered in other concepts.

## Function Declaration

The standard way of defining a function in JavaScript is a _function declaration_, also called _function definition_ or _function statement_.

It consists of the `function` keyword, the name of the function, and a comma-separated list of parameters enclosed in parentheses.
This is followed by the function body (collection of statements that defines what a function does) wrapped in curly braces.

```javascript
function someName(param1, param2, param3) {
  // ...
}
```

In JavaScript, a function is invoked (called) by stating the function name followed by parentheses that contain the arguments.

```javascript
someName(arg1, arg2, arg3);
```

## Parameters

When working with parameters inside the function body, be aware of possible side effects.

- Values of [primitive data types][mdn-primitives] are _immutable_.
  The original value is never affected by what happens to the argument in the function body.

```javascript
const num = 0;

function add(num) {
  return num + 1;
}

add(num);
// => 1

num;
// => 0
```

- It is different for values like _objects_, _arrays_, _functions_.
  Since the reference is copied, a reassignment will not affect the original value.
  However, since you are dealing with a [shallow copy][wikipedia-shalllow-copy], modifying the argument in the function body will also change the original value that was passed in.

```javascript
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];

function add(arr) {
  arr.push(5);
}

add(nums);

nums;
// => (6) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

If a function is provided with fewer arguments than there are parameters,
the missing arguments will be `undefined` inside the function body, see [Null and Undefined][concept-null-undefined].
In many cases, it makes more sense to initialize a parameter with a _default_ value if no value or `undefined` property is passed.

```javascript
function someName(param1 = defaultValue1, param2 = defaultValue2) {
  // ...
}
```

A function can be invoked (called) with more arguments than there were parameters in the function definition.
All arguments, including those excess arguments, can be found in the [arguments "array"][mdn-arguments-object].

It is also possible to define functions that accept an arbitrary number of arguments (variadic functions),
see rest parameters in [Rest and Spread Operators][concept-rest-and-spread] for more details.

It is also important to notice that when invoking a function,
the order in which the parameters are defined is the order in which the arguments should be passed in.

```javascript
function printNumbers(num1, num2, num3, num4) {
  console.log('1: ', num1);
  console.log('2: ', num2);
  console.log('3: ', num3);
  console.log('4: ', num4);
}

printNumbers(4, 2, 1, 3);
// => 1:  4
// => 2:  2
// => 3:  1
// => 4:  3

printNumbers(1, 3, 4);
// => 1:  1
// => 2:  3
// => 3:  4
// => 4:  undefined
```

## Return Statement

A function can have multiple `return` statements. A return statement ends the function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.

```javascript
function checkNumber(num) {
  if (num === 0) {
    return 'You passed 0, please provide another number.';
  }

  return 'Thanks for passing such a nice number.';
}
```

The result of a function that `return`s no value or does not have a `return` statement is `undefined`.
There are no implicit `return`s in JavaScript.

```javascript
function nakedReturn(a) {
  a * 2;
  return;
}

nakedReturn(1);
// => undefined

function noReturn(a) {
  a * 2;
}

noReturn(1);
// => undefined
```

In JavaScript, you can only return exactly one value.
If you want to pass more information, you need to combine it into one entity first, usually into an [object][concept-objects], or an [array][concept-arrays].

```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
  return {
    quotient: Math.floor(a / b),
    remainder: a % b,
  };
}
```

## Function Expression

A function declaration is a standalone statement.
But sometimes it is helpful to define a function as part of another expression, e.g., in an assignment, as a function parameter ([callback][concept-callbacks]) or as value in an [object][concept-objects].
This can be done with a function expression.
It has the same syntax as a function declaration, only that the function name can be omitted to create an _anonymous function_.

```javascript
const someFunction = function (param) {
  // ...
};

someOtherFunction(function (param) {
  //...
});

const obj = {
  someFunction: function (param) {
    // ...
  },
};
```

## Instructions

In this exercise, you are going to write some more code related to preparing and cooking your brilliant lasagna from your favorite cookbook.

You have five tasks.
The first one is related to the cooking itself, the other four are about the perfect preparation.

## 1. Determine whether the lasagna is done

When you have lasagna in the oven, you want to know whether you can already take it out or not.
To make sure the lasagna does not burn in the oven, you usually set a timer.
But sometimes you forget about that.

Write a function `cookingStatus` with that accepts the remaining time on the timer in minutes as a parameter.
The function has three possible results.

- If the timer shows `0`, it should return `'Lasagna is done.'`.
- If the timer shows any other number, the result should be `'Not done, please wait.'`.
- If the function is called without a timer value, the result should be `'You forgot to set the timer.'`.

The timer will never show a value below 0.

```javascript
cookingStatus(12);
// => 'Not done, please wait.'

cookingStatus();
// => 'You forgot to set the timer.'
```

## 2. Estimate the preparation time

For the next lasagna that you will prepare, you want to make sure you have enough time reserved so you can enjoy the cooking.
You already made a plan which layers your lasagna will have.
Now you want to estimate how long the preparation will take based on that.

Implement a function `preparationTime` that accepts an array of layers and the average preparation time per layer in minutes.
The function should return the estimate for the total preparation time based on the number of layers.
If the function is called without providing the average preparation time, `2` minutes should be assumed instead.

```javascript
const layers = ['sauce', 'noodles', 'sauce', 'meat', 'mozzarella', 'noodles'];
preparationTime(layers, 3);
// => 18

preparationTime(layers);
// => 12
```

## 3. Compute the amounts of noodles and sauce needed

Besides reserving the time, you also want to make sure you have enough sauce and noodles to cook the lasagna of your dreams.
For each noodle layer in your lasagna, you will need 50 grams of noodles.
For each sauce layer in your lasagna, you will need 0.2 liters of sauce.

Define the function `quantities` that takes an array of layers as a parameter.
The function will then determine the quantity of noodles and sauce needed to make your meal.
The result should be returned as an object with keys `noodles` and `sauce`.

```javascript
quantities(['sauce', 'noodles', 'sauce', 'meat', 'mozzarella', 'noodles']);
// => { noodles: 100, sauce: 0.4 }
```

## 4. Add the secret ingredient

A while ago you visited a friend and ate lasagna there.
It was amazing and had something special to it.
The friend sent you the list of ingredients and told you the last item on the list is the "secret ingredient" that made the meal so special.
Now you want to add that secret ingredient to your recipe as well.

Write a function `addSecretIngredient` that accepts two arrays of ingredients as parameters.
The first parameter is the list your friend sent you, the second is the ingredient list for your own recipe.
The function should add the last item from your friend's list to the end of your list.
The array that represents your recipe should be modified directly and the function should not return anything.
However, the first argument should not be modified.

```javascript
const friendsList = ['noodles', 'sauce', 'mozzarella', 'kampot pepper'];
const myList = ['noodles', 'meat', 'sauce', 'mozzarella'];

addSecretIngredient(friendsList, myList);
// => undefined

console.log(myList);
// => ['noodles', 'meat', 'sauce', 'mozzarella', 'kampot pepper']
```

## 5. Scale the recipe

The amounts listed in your cookbook only yield enough lasagna for two portions.
Since you want to cook for more people next time, you want to calculate the amounts for different numbers of portions.

Implement a function `scaleRecipe` that takes two parameters.

- A recipe object that holds the amounts needed for 2 portions.
  The format of the object can be seen in the example below.
- The number of portions you want to cook.

The function should return a recipe object with the amounts needed for the desired number of portions.
You want to keep the original recipe though.
This means, in this task the recipe argument should not be modified.

```javascript
const recipe = {
  noodles: 200,
  sauce: 0.5,
  mozzarella: 1,
  meat: 100,
};

scaleRecipe(recipe, 4);
// =>
// {
//   noodles: 400,
//   sauce: 1,
//   mozzarella: 2,
//   meat: 200,
// };

console.log(recipe);
// =>
// {
//   noodles: 200,
//   sauce: 0.5,
//   mozzarella: 1,
//   meat: 100,
// };
```
