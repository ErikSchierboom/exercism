# Word Search

Welcome to Word Search on Exercism's JavaScript Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific
words in them.

For example:

```text
jefblpepre
camdcimgtc
oivokprjsm
pbwasqroua
rixilelhrs
wolcqlirpc
screeaumgr
alxhpburyi
jalaycalmp
clojurermt
```

There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.

Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left,
vertical and diagonal.

Given a puzzle and a list of words return the location of the first and last
letter of each word.
