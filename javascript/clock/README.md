# Clock

Welcome to Clock on Exercism's JavaScript Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

Using the built-in [Date class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) and its methods is not allowed.
