# Lucian's Luscious Lasagna

Welcome to Lucian's Luscious Lasagna on Exercism's JavaScript Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

JavaScript is a dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

## (Re-)Assignment

There are a few primary ways to assign values to names in JavaScript - using variables or constants. On Exercism, variables are always written in [camelCase][wiki-camel-case]; constants are written in [SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE][wiki-snake-case]. There is no official guide to follow, and various companies and organizations have various style guides. _Feel free to write variables any way you like_. The upside from writing them the way the exercises are prepared is that they'll be highlighted differently in the web interface and most IDEs.

Variables in JavaScript can be defined using the [`const`][mdn-const], [`let`][mdn-let] or [`var`][mdn-var] keyword.

A variable can reference different values over its lifetime when using `let` or `var`. For example, `myFirstVariable` can be defined and redefined many times using the assignment operator `=`:

```javascript
let myFirstVariable = 1;
myFirstVariable = 'Some string';
myFirstVariable = new SomeComplexClass();
```

In contrast to `let` and `var`, variables that are defined with `const` can only be assigned once. This is used to define constants in JavaScript.

```javascript
const MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 10;

// Can not be re-assigned.
MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 20;
// => TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

> ðŸ’¡ In a later Concept Exercise the difference between _constant_ assignment / binding and _constant_ value is explored and explained.

## Function Declarations

In JavaScript, units of functionality are encapsulated in _functions_, usually grouping functions together in the same file if they belong together. These functions can take parameters (arguments), and can _return_ a value using the `return` keyword. Functions are invoked using `()` syntax.

```javascript
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

add(1, 3);
// => 4
```

> ðŸ’¡ In JavaScript there are _many_ different ways to declare a function. These other ways look different than using the `function` keyword. The track tries to gradually introduce them, but if you already know about them, feel free to use any of them. In most cases, using one or the other isn't better or worse.

## Exposing to Other Files

To make a `function`, a constant, or a variable available in _other files_, they need to be [exported][mdn-export] using the `export` keyword. Another file may then [import][mdn-import] these using the `import` keyword. This is also known as the module system. A great example is how all the tests work. Each exercise has at least one file, for example `lasagna.js`, which contains the _implementation_. Additionally there is at least one other file, for example `lasagna.spec.js`, that contains the _tests_. This file _imports_ the public (i.e. exported) entities in order to test the implementation:

```javascript
// file.js
export const MY_VALUE = 10;

export function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

// file.spec.js
import { MY_VALUE, add } from './file';

add(MY_VALUE, 5);
// => 15
```

## Instructions

Lucian's girlfriend is on her way home, and he hasn't cooked their anniversary dinner!

In this exercise, you're going to write some code to help Lucian cook an exquisite lasagna from his favorite cookbook.

You have four tasks related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.

## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

Define the `EXPECTED_MINUTES_IN_OVEN` constant that represents how many minutes the lasagna should be in the oven. It must be exported. According to the cooking book, the expected oven time in minutes is `40`.

## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

Implement the `remainingMinutesInOven` function that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as a _parameter_ and _returns_ how many minutes the lasagna still has to remain in the oven, based on the **expected oven time in minutes** from the previous task.

```javascript
remainingMinutesInOven(30);
// => 10
```

## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

Implement the `preparationTimeInMinutes` function that takes the number of layers you added to the lasagna as a _parameter_ and _returns_ how many minutes you spent preparing the lasagna, assuming each layer takes you 2 minutes to prepare.

```javascript
preparationTimeInMinutes(2);
// => 4
```

## 4. Calculate the total working time in minutes

Implement the `totalTimeInMinutes` function that takes _two parameters_: the `numberOfLayers` parameter is the number of layers you added to the lasagna, and the `actualMinutesInOven` parameter is the number of minutes the lasagna has been in the oven. The function should _return_ how many minutes in total you've worked on cooking the lasagna, which is the sum of the preparation time in minutes, and the time in minutes the lasagna has spent in the oven at the moment.

```javascript
totalTimeInMinutes(3, 20);
// => 26
```
