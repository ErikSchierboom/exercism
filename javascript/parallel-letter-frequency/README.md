# Parallel Letter Frequency

Welcome to Parallel Letter Frequency on Exercism's JavaScript Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially.
A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.

Due to the single-threaded nature of Javascript, code that appears to execute in parallel,
such as `async functions` or `Promises`, actually execute concurrently.
Such solutions will pass all the tests, even though they do not meet the requrement for parallel execution.

## Concurency vs. Parallelism

Here's a quick definition for each that illustrates the diferences between the two:

- Concurrency is when two or more tasks can start, run and complete in overlapping time periods, being executed by the same processing unit.
- Parallelism is when two or more tasks can start and run at the same time, being executed independently of eachother by separate processing units.

## Parallelism in Javascript

Even though Javascript by default is single-threaded, there is a way to execute code non-concurently,
through the [Web Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).

As described by MDN:

> Web Workers makes it possible to run a script operation in a background thread separate from the main execution thread of a web application.

Here's a simple demo (taken from [here](https://medium.com/@ns-tech-learn/what-is-a-web-worker-how-to-use-it-and-example-2273de521f04))

```js
// main.js
const myWorker = new Worker('worker.js');

myWorker.postMessage(5);

myWorker.onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log('Received result from worker:', event.data);
};
```

```js
// worker.js
onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log('Received number from main thread:', event.data);

  // Perform computation
  const result = event.data * 2;

  // Send result back to the main thread
  postMessage(result);
};
```

As a stretch goal, consider if your implementation can be adapted to make use of `Web workers`.
