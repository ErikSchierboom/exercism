# Hints

## 1. Double every single card

- There is a built-in method great for [simple transforms][map_method_docs] like this.

## 2. Create multiple copies of every 3 found in the deck

- There is a built-in method perfect for custom transforms or [accumulations][reduce_method_docs] (like summing an array, etc.)

## 3. Find two cards from the exact middle of the deck

- There is a built-in method for [slicing and dicing][slice_method_docs] arrays into smaller segments.

## 4. The outside two cards will reappear in the middle of the deck

- There is a built-in method for [inserting or removing][splice_method_docs] items from the middle of an array.
- Array also has built-ins for removing the first and last elements, see [MDN Array documentation][array_docs].

## 5. Every card that isn't 2 disappears

- There is a built-in method for [filtering][filter_method_docs] or excluding items in an array.

## 6. Convert a shuffled deck into a perfectly ordered deck

- There is a built-in method for [sorting][sort_method_docs].

## 7. Reorder the deck

- There is a built-in method for [reversing][reverse_method_docs] an array.
