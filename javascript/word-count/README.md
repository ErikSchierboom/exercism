# Word Count

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```text
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for ECMAScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

http://exercism.io/languages/ecmascript

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by
changing `xtest` to `test`.
