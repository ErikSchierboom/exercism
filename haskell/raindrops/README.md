# Raindrops

Welcome to Raindrops on Exercism's Haskell Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder. The simplest way to test if a one number is a factor of another is to use the [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation).

The rules of `raindrops` are that if a given number:

- has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
- has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
- has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
- _does not_ have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.

## Examples

- 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
- 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
- 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".

You need to implement the `convert` function that returns number converted to
raindrop sound. You can use the provided signature if you are unsure
about the types, but don't let it restrict your creativity:

```haskell
convert :: Int -> String
```

This exercise works with textual data. For historical reasons, Haskell's
`String` type is synonymous with `[Char]`, a list of characters. For more
efficient handling of textual data, the `Text` type can be used.

As an optional extension to this exercise, you can

- Read about [string types](https://haskell-lang.org/tutorial/string-types) in Haskell.
- Add `- text` to your list of dependencies in package.yaml.
- Import `Data.Text` in [the following way](https://hackernoon.com/4-steps-to-a-better-imports-list-in-haskell-43a3d868273c):

```haskell
import qualified Data.Text as T
import           Data.Text (Text)
```

- You can now write e.g. `convert :: Int -> Text` and refer to `Data.Text` combinators as e.g. `T.pack`.
- Look up the documentation for [`Data.Text`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text/docs/Data-Text.html),
- You can then replace all occurrences of `String` with `Text` in Raindrops.hs:

```haskell
convert :: Int -> Text
```

This part is entirely optional.
