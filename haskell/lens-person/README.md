# Lens Person

(Haskell specific) use lenses to update nested records.

Updating fields of nested records is kind of annoying in Haskell. One solution
is to use [lenses](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lens).  Implement several record
accessing functions using lenses, you may use any library you want. The test
suite also allows you to avoid lenses alltogether so you can experiment with
different approaches.

Help](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-haskell.html) for
instructions to get started writing Haskell.

## Running Tests

Use `runhaskell` (included in the Haskell Platform) to compile and run your
Haskell code.

    $ runhaskell -Wall bob_test.hs
