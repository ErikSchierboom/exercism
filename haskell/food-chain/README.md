# Food Chain

Welcome to Food Chain on Exercism's Haskell Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'.

While you could copy/paste the lyrics,
or read them from a file, this problem is much more
interesting if you approach it algorithmically.

This is a [cumulative song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_song) of unknown origin.

This is one of many common variants.

This exercise is about [code refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring),
so we are providing you with a solution that already passes the tests.

The challenge is to rewrite it until you are proud of it, and learn
something in the process.

If you don't know where to start, here are some ideas:

- Try to reduce repetition to a minimum.
- Try to make the code readable.
- Generalize your solution, allowing the lady to swallow other things.

Take your time.

Change one thing at a time and check if your solution still passes the tests.

Have fun!
