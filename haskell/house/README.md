# House

## Instructions

Recite the nursery rhyme 'This is the House that Jack Built'.

> [The] process of placing a phrase of clause within another phrase of
> clause is called embedding. It is through the processes of recursion
> and embedding that we are able to take a finite number of forms (words
> and phrases) and construct an infinite number of expressions.
> Furthermore, embedding also allows us to construct an infinitely long
> structure, in theory anyway.

This is the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat

This is the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the maiden all forlorn
that milked the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the man all tattered and torn
that kissed the maiden all forlorn
that milked the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat
that killed the rat
that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the priest all shaven and shorn
that married the man all tattered and torn
that kissed the maiden all forlorn
that milked the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat

that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the rooster that crowed in the morn
that woke the priest all shaven and shorn

that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the farmer sowing his corn

that milked the cow with the crumpled horn
that tossed the dog
that worried the cat

This exercise is about [code refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring),
so we are providing you with a solution that already passes the tests.

The challenge is to rewrite it until you are proud of it, and learn
something in the process.

If you don't know where to start, here are some ideas:

- Try to reduce repetition to a minimum.
- Try to make the code readable.

Take your time.

Change one thing at a time and check if your solution still passes the tests.

Have fun!
