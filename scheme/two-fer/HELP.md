## Running the tests

Simply type `make chez` if you're using ChezScheme or `make guile` if you're using GNU Guile.

## Using the REPL

- Enter `test.scm` at the repl prompt.
- Develop your solution in the file `problem.scm` reloading as you go.
- Run `(test)` to check your solution.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit two-fer.scm` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
