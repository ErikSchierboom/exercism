# Help

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `bal test --offline` from within the exercise directory.

## Skipped tests

Initially, only the first test will be enabled.
This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `enable: false` property from the next test and work on getting that test passing.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit leap.bal` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
