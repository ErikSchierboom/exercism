# Hints

## General

- The [Prolog basics page](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/prolog/prolog_basics.htm) explains what facts and rules are and how to define them

## 1. List the chatty people

- You're defining a [fact](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/prolog/prolog_basics.htm)
- You can define multiple "instances" of the same fact
- Remember to use lowercase names

## 2. List who likes whom

- You're defining a [fact](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/prolog/prolog_basics.htm)
- You can define multiple "instances" of the same fact
- Remember to use lowercase names
- The first argument is the person liking the other person
- The second argument is the person being liked by the other person

## 3. People who like each other make a good pairing

- You're defining a [rule](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/prolog/prolog_basics.htm)
- In Prolog, making sure that two facts/rules are both true is done via a [conjunction](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/prolog/prolog_conjunctions_and_disjunctions.htm)

## 4. Chatty people pair with anyone

- You're defining a [rule](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/prolog/prolog_basics.htm)
- In Prolog, making sure that at least one of two facts/rules is true is done via a [disjunction](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/prolog/prolog_conjunctions_and_disjunctions.htm)
