# Magic Square

Welcome to Magic Square on Exercism's Prolog Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Your task is to, given a square of positive integers, determine if the square is a magic square.
A magic square is one where the sum of the numbers in each row, column and both diagonals are the same.

As an example, consider the following square:

```text
4 9 2
3 5 7
8 1 6
```

This is a magic square, as the sum of every row, column and both diagonals is equal to 15.
