# Pythagorean Triplet

Welcome to Pythagorean Triplet on Exercism's Prolog Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

```text
a² + b² = c²
```

and such that,

```text
a < b < c
```

For example,

```text
3² + 4² = 5².
```

Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.

## Bonus

The last test is a bonus test and is optional.
Try and enable this test to see how well your code works on a large input sum.
