## Running the tests

To run the test suite:
```bash
tclsh exercise.test
```

## Skipped tests

Solving an exercise means making all its tests pass. By default, only one
test (the first one) is executed when you run the tests. This is
intentional, as it allows you to focus on just making that one test pass.
Once it passes, you can enable the next test by commenting out or removing
the `skip` command preceding it.

Alternately, to run all the tests regardless of their "skipped" status:
```bash
RUN_ALL=1 tclsh exercise.test
```

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit acronym.tcl` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
