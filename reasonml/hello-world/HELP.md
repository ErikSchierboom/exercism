## Running the tests

There is a one time setup for each exercise, which may take a few minutes:

```
npm install
```

Open two shells, and in the first, start the build process.

```
npm start
```

In the second, start the tests running.

```
npm test
```

As you edit the code, the two processes will continually rebuild and rerun the tests.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit src/HelloWorld.re` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
