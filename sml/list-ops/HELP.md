## Running the tests

You can run the tests by opening a command prompt in the exercise's directory, and then running:

```bash
$ poly -q --use test.sml
```

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit list-ops.sml` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.
