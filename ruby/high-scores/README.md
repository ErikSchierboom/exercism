# High Scores

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era. Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score, the three highest scores, and a report on the difference between the last and the highest scores.

In this exercise you're going to instantiate a class and add some instance methods. http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/writing_classes/initializers.html

A HighScore accepts an array with one or more numbers, each representing one 'game score'. The Array class can offer inspiration for working with arrays. https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Array.html
