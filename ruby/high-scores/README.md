# High Scores

Welcome to High Scores on Exercism's Ruby Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era. Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

In this exercise you're going to instantiate a class and add some instance methods. http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/writing_classes/initializers.html

A HighScore accepts an array with one or more numbers, each representing one 'game score'. The Array class can offer inspiration for working with arrays. https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Array.html
