# Robot Name

Manage robot factory settings.

When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.

The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated in the format
of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings,
which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will
respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
Random names means a risk of collisions. Your solution must ensure that
every existing robot has a unique name.


In order to make this easier to test, your solution will need to implement a
`Robot.forget` method that clears any shared state that might exist to track
duplicate robot names.

Bonus points if this method does not need to do anything for your solution.

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[Ruby resources page](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby/resources).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

Run the tests from the exercise directory using the following command:

    ruby robot_name_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -r minitest/pride robot_name_test.rb
