## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `gleam test` from within the exercise directory.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit src/difference_of_squares.gleam` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
