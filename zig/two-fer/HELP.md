## Running the tests

Write your code in `<exercise_name>.zig`.

To run the tests for an exercise, run:

```bash
zig test test_exercise_name.zig
```

in the exercise's root directory (replacing `exercise_name` with the name of the exercise).

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit two_fer.zig` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
