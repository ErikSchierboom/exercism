# Matching Brackets

Welcome to Matching Brackets on Exercism's Zig Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given a string containing brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, parentheses `()`, or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched and nested correctly.
The string may also contain other characters, which for the purposes of this exercise should be ignored.

## Constraints

You may assume that the input to `isBalanced` never contains more than 10 levels of nesting.

Feel free to solve this exercise without using the `allocator`, but note that the `isBalanced` function cannot return just `bool`, because the tests use `try`.
