# Raindrops

Welcome to Raindrops on Exercism's Pharo Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Introduction

Raindrops is a slightly more complex version of the FizzBuzz challenge, a classic interview question.

## Instructions

Your task is to convert a number into its corresponding raindrop sounds.

If a given number:

- is divisible by 3, add "Pling" to the result.
- is divisible by 5, add "Plang" to the result.
- is divisible by 7, add "Plong" to the result.
- **is not** divisible by 3, 5, or 7, the result should be the number as a string.

## Examples

- 28 is divisible by 7, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be `"Plong"`.
- 30 is divisible by 3 and 5, but not 7, so the result would be `"PlingPlang"`.
- 34 is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be `"34"`.

~~~~exercism/note
A common way to test if one number is evenly divisible by another is to compare the [remainder][remainder] or [modulus][modulo] to zero.
Most languages provide operators or functions for one (or both) of these.

[modulo]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation

Try to focus on using Test Driven Development for this exercise. Run the tests, one by one and try to solve the problem incrementally as it unfolds. When everything passes, see if you can refactor it to make it less repetitive.
