# Help

## Running the tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.

If you are still stuck, the track documentation has detailed help for [running tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/tests).

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit Leap.class.st` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
