# Difference of Squares

Welcome to Difference of Squares on Exercism's F# Track.

## Instructions

Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.

Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first
ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

You are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from
first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged. Finding the best
algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.

For this exercise the following F# features come in handy:
https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/reference/fsharp-core-operators.html#(%20..%20)) allows you to succinctly create a range of values.
- [List.sumBy](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/reference/fsharp-collections-listmodule.html#sumBy) is a condensed format to apply a function to a list and then sum the results.
