# Parallel Letter Frequency

Welcome to Parallel Letter Frequency on Exercism's F# Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done
sequentially. A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a
list of texts and that employs parallelism.

For this exercise the following F# feature comes in handy:

- [Asynchronous programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/concurrency-async-and-parallel/) .NET has asynchronous functionality built-in which enables you to run things in parallel (assuming you have a multi-core processor which is becoming more an more common) easily
