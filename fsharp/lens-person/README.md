# Lens Person

Use lenses to update nested records (specific to languages with immutable data).

Updating fields of nested records is kind of annoying in Haskell. One solution
is to use [lenses](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lens).  Implement several record
accessing functions using lenses, you may use any library you want. The test
suite also allows you to avoid lenses alltogether so you can experiment with
different approaches.

## Hints
- This exercise expects you to use the [Aether](https://xyncro.tech/aether/) library, which adds *lenses* functionality to F#. With lenses, you can quite easily read or update nested structures.
