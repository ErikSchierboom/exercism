## Running the tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ gradlew test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

## Skipped tests

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore` annotation.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit src/main/kotlin/HelloWorld.kt` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
