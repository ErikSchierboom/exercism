## Running the tests

There is a Perl script with the extension `.t` contained in the `t/` directory, which will be used to test your solution.
You can run through the tests by using the command:

```bash
`prove`
```

Documentation about the assertions used in the test files can be found in [Test2::Manual::Testing::Introduction][test2-manual].

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit lib/HelloWorld.pm` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
