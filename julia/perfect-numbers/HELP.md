# Help

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run this command from within the exercise directory:

```bash
$ julia runtests.jl
```

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit perfect-numbers.jl` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
