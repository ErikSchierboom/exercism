## Introduction

Your friend Ashley enjoys art inspired by mathematics and you would like to make them a cute birthday card.
You have seen the variety of patterns (rays, parabolas, partial symmetry, oh my) in [this plot of pythagorean triplets][plot] and think you could make something neat with them.

The next step on your creative journey is to find some pythagorean triplets!

## Instructions

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

```text
a² + b² = c²
```

and such that,

```text
a < b < c
```

For example,

```text
3² + 4² = 5².
```

Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.
