## Running the tests

To compile and run the tests, just run the following in your exercise directory:

```shell
nim r test_exercise_name.nim
```

Replace `exercise_name` with the name of the exercise (e.g. `all_your_base`).

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit linked_list.nim` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
