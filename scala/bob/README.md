# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He answers 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yell a question at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

The Scala exercises assume an SBT project scheme. The exercise solution source
should be placed within the exercise directory/src/main/scala. The exercise
unit tests can be found within the exercise directory/src/test/scala.

To run the tests simply run the command `sbt test` in the exercise directory.

For more detailed info about the Scala track see the [help
page](http://exercism.io/languages/scala).
