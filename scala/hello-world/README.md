# Hello World

Welcome to Hello World on Exercism's Scala Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Common pitfalls that you should avoid
- Usually there is no need in Scala to use `return`. For a discussion see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24856106/return-in-a-scala-function-literal). Or as a quote from that discussion: *Don't use return, it makes Scala cry.*
