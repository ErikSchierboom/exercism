# Lens Person

Welcome to Lens Person on Exercism's Scala Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Use lenses to update nested records (specific to languages with immutable data).

Updating fields of nested records is kind of annoying in Haskell. One solution
is to use [lenses](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lens).  Implement several record
accessing functions using lenses, you may use any library you want. The test
suite also allows you to avoid lenses altogether so you can experiment with
different approaches.
