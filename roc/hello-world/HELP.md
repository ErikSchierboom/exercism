## Running the tests

Roc comes with its own integrated test tools, no need to install anything else.

To test your solution to an exercise, open a terminal, go to the exercise directory, run `roc test <exercise-name>-test.roc`, for example `roc test hello-world-test.roc`, and ensure that all the tests pass.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit HelloWorld.roc` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor

## Need to get help?
