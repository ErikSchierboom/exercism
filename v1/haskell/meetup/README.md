# Meetup

Calculate the date of meetups.

Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.

Examples are

- the first Monday
- the third Tuesday
- the Wednesteenth
- the last Thursday

There are exactly 7 days that end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is
guaranteed that each day of the week will have a '-teenth' in every
month.
