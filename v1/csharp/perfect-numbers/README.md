# Perfect Numbers

The Greek mathematician Nicomachus devised a classification scheme for natural numbers.

The Greek mathematican Nicomachus devised a classification scheme for
natural numbers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the
categories of _abundant_, _perfect_, or _deficient_.  A perfect number
equals the sum of its positive divisors â€” the pairs of numbers whose
product yields the target number, excluding the number itself.

- Perfect: Sum of factors = number
- Abundant: Sum of factors > number
- Deficient: Sum of factors < number

The Aliquot sum is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not
including the number itself.

## Examples

- 6 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 3 and 6 = 1 + 2 +
  3.
- 28 is perfect number because 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.
- Prime numbers 7, 13, etc are Deficient by the Nicomachus
  classification.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.
