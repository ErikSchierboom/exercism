# Custom Set

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.
