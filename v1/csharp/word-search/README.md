# Word Search

Create a program to solve a word search puzzle.

In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific
words in them.

For example:

```
gefblpepre
cbmdcimguc
oikoknrjsm
pbwjrqrota
rixilelhgs
woncqlispc
schemekmgr
alxhprubyi
javaocamlp
clojurermt
```

There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.

Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left,
vertical and diagonal.

Create a program that given a puzzle and a list of words returns the location
of the first and last letter of each word.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.



## Submitting Incomplete Problems
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
