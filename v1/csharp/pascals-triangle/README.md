# Pascals Triangle

Write a program that computes Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

In Pascal's Triangle each number is computed by adding the numbers to
the right and left of the current position in the previous row.

```plain
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
# ... etc
```

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.
