# Sum Of Multiples

Write a program that, given a number, can find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 up to but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or
5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Allow the program to be configured to find the sum of multiples of
numbers other than 3 and 5.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.
