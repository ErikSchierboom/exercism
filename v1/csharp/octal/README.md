# Octal

Write a program that will convert a octal number, represented as a string (e.g. '1735263'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (i.e. no, you may not use built-in ruby libraries or gems to accomplish the conversion).


### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.
