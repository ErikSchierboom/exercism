# Help

## Running the tests

A `Makefile` is provided with a default target to compile your solution and run the tests. At the command line in your exercise's directory, type:

```bash
make
```

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit difference_of_squares.ml` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
