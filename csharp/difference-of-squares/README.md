# Difference of Squares

Welcome to Difference of Squares on Exercism's C# Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.

Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first
ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

You are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from
first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged. Finding the best
algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.

This exercise requires you to process a collection of data. You can simplify your code by using LINQ (Language Integrated Query).
