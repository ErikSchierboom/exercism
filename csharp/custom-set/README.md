# Custom Set

Welcome to Custom Set on Exercism's C# Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

This exercise requires you to create custom equality comparison logic.
For more information, see [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.equals?view=netcore-2.0#System_Object_Equals_System_Object_).
