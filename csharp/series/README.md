# Series

Write a program that will take a string of digits and give you all the possible consecutive number series of length `n` in that string.

For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

- 012
- 123
- 234

And the following 4-digit series:

- 0123
- 1234

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve
whatever you get.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.
