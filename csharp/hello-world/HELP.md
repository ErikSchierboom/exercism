## Running the tests

You can run the tests by opening a command prompt in the exercise's directory, and then running the [`dotnet test` command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test)
Alternatively, most IDE's have built-in support for running tests, including [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer), [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Unit_Testing_in_Solution.html) and [Visual Studio code](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/How-to-run-and-debug-unit-tests).
See the [tests page](https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/csharp/tests) for more information.

## Skipped tests

Initially, only the first test will be enabled.
This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `Skip` property from the next test and work on getting that test passing.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit HelloWorld.cs` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
