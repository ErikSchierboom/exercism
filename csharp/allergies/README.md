# Allergies

Write a program that, given a person's allergy score, can tell them whether or not they're allergic to a given item, and their full list of allergies.

An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the
information about all the allergies the person has (that they were
tested for).

The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

* eggs (1)
* peanuts (2)
* shellfish (4)
* strawberries (8)
* tomatoes (16)
* chocolate (32)
* pollen (64)
* cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able to say:

- Whether Tom is allergic to any one of those allergens listed above.
- All the allergens Tom is allergic to.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.
