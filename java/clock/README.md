# Clock

Welcome to Clock on Exercism's Java Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

In order to satisfy the requirement that two clocks are considered equal just when they are set to the same time, you will need to override the [`equals`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)) and [`hashcode`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode) methods in your `Clock` class.
 
For more information on how to override these methods, see [this JavaWorld article](https://web.archive.org/web/20170528222153/http://www.javaworld.com/article/2072762/java-app-dev/object-equality.html).
