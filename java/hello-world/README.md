# Hello World

Welcome to Hello World on Exercism's Java Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

Since this is your first Java exercise, we've included a detailed TUTORIAL.md
file that guides you through your solution. Check it out for tips and
assistance!
