## Running the tests

Choose your operating system:

- [Windows](#windows)
- [macOS](#macos)
- [Linux](#linux)

## Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt.
2. Get the first exercise:

   ```batchfile
   C:\Users\JohnDoe>exercism download --exercise hello-world --track java
   ```

3. Change directory into the exercism:

   ```batchfile
   C:\Users\JohnDoe>cd C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\java\hello-world
   ```

4. Run the tests:

   ```batchfile
   C:\Users\JohnDoe>gradlew.bat test
   ```

   _(Don't worry about the tests failing, at first, this is how you begin each exercise.)_

5. Solve the exercise. Find and work through the `instructions.append.md` guide ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/exercism/java/blob/main/exercises/practice/hello-world/.docs/instructions.append.md#tutorial)).

Good luck! Have fun!
