# Parallel Letter Frequency

Welcome to Parallel Letter Frequency on Exercism's Java Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially.
A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Employ parallelism to calculate the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts.

As a stretch goal, consider if your implementation will work for characters with [diacritics or accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic). For example, such solutions should not consider e and Ã« the same character. An example text for this case is [Wilhelmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelmus), the Dutch national anthem.
