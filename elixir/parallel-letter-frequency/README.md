# Parallel Letter Frequency

Welcome to Parallel Letter Frequency on Exercism's Elixir Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done
sequentially. A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a
list of texts and that employs parallelism.
