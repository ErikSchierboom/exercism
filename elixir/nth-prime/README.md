# Nth Prime

Welcome to Nth Prime on Exercism's Elixir Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that
the 6th prime is 13.

If your language provides methods in the standard library to deal with prime
numbers, pretend they don't exist and implement them yourself.

## Slow tests

One or several of the tests of this exercise have been tagged as `:slow`, because they might take a long time to finish. For this reason, they will not be run on the platform by the automated test runner. If you are solving this exercise directly on the platform in the web editor, you might want to consider downloading this exercise to your machine instead. This will allow you to run all the tests and check the efficiency of your solution.
